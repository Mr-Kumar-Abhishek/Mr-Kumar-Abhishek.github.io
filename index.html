                                <p>Welcome. I am a Software Developer who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping">prototypes software</a>. If you have come to this site by an old reference, my apologies. I am redesigning my website and turning it into a blog. This is just a temporary design (and a work in progress), however it is fully functional without any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development" >frontend</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends">backend</a> breaks.</p>
