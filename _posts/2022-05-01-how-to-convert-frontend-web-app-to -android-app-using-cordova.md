Hi, in this tutorial I will convert a frontend web app made from HTML, CSS, and Javascript to an android app that could be published to the google play store via Cordova. 

If you don't know how to set up Cordova, [refer to my previous article.](../../../2022/04/30/how-to-setup-cordova-in-xubuntu-or-ubuntu-for-android-development-full-guide)
