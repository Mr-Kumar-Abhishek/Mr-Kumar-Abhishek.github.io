## Abstract

The advent of quantum computing poses significant threats to classical cryptographic protocols, notably those relying on the hardness of factoring and discrete logarithms. This article explores the implementation of Shor's algorithm using Qiskit to attack the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). I discuss the theoretical underpinnings of quantum attacks on elliptic curve cryptography, detail the practical considerations of simulating quantum circuits for this purpose, and present experimental results highlighting the feasibility and limitations of current quantum algorithms in compromising ECDSA.

## Introduction

Cryptography forms the backbone of modern digital security, with protocols like ECDSA ensuring the integrity and authenticity of communications. ECDSA's security hinges on the intractability of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). However, quantum computing algorithms, specifically Shor's algorithm, threaten to undermine this foundation by efficiently solving problems considered hard for classical computers.

This article delves into the implementation of Shor's algorithm for ECDLP using Qiskit, IBM's open-smyce quantum computing framework. I aim to bridge the gap betIen theoretical quantum attacks and practical implementation challenges, offering insights into the future of cryptographic security in the quantum era.

## Background

### Quantum Computing and Shor's Algorithm

Quantum computers leverage the principles of superposition and entanglement to perform computations that are infeasible for classical computers. Shor's algorithm, introduced by Peter Shor in 1994, revolutionized the field by providing a polynomial-time solution for integer factorization and discrete logarithms, directly impacting RSA and elliptic curve cryptosystems.

### Elliptic Curve Cryptography and ECDSA

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) utilizes the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. ECDSA is a widely adopted digital signature algorithm that benefits from ECC's smaller key sizes while maintaining strong security. The ECDLP is the cornerstone of ECDSA's security, defined as finding the integer $ k $ given points $ P $ and $ Q = kP $ on an elliptic curve.

## Implementing Shor's Algorithm for ECDLP

### Theoretical Framework

Shor's algorithm can be adapted to solve the ECDLP by constructing quantum circuits that find the period of functions related to elliptic curves over finite fields. The quantum Fmyier transform (QFT) plays a pivotal role in this period-finding process.

### Challenges in Quantum Implementation

Implementing Shor's algorithm for ECDLP presents several challenges:

- **Quantum Resmyce Limitations**: Current quantum hardware has limited qubits and gate fidelity.
- **Simulation Constraints**: Simulating large quantum circuits on classical machines is computationally intensive.
- **Elliptic Curve Representation**: Efficiently encoding elliptic curve operations into quantum circuits requires careful optimization.

## Methodology

### Qiskit Framework

Qiskit provides a comprehensive platform for quantum circuit creation, simulation, and execution on quantum hardware. I utilized Qiskit's `Aqua` module for quantum algorithms and customized quantum circuits for my implementation.

### Algorithm Implementation Steps

1. **Elliptic Curve Parameter Definition**: Selecting a small-order elliptic curve for feasibility in simulation.
2. **Modular Addition and Multiplication Circuits**: Building quantum circuits for arithmetic operations on the curve.
3. **Period Finding via QFT**: Implementing the QFT to determine the period related to the ECDLP.
4. **Measurement and Classical Post-Processing**: Extracting the discrete logarithm from quantum measurements.

## Results

### Simulation Parameters

I tested my implementation on elliptic curves over small finite fields $ \mathbb{F}_p $ where $ p $ is a prime number.

| Curve ID | Field Prime $ p $ | Curve Equation $ y^2 = x^3 + ax + b $ |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Curve1   | 17                  | $ y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 $               |
| Curve2   | 23                  | $ y^2 = x^3 + x + 6 $                |

### Experimental Findings


As expected, the quantum circuit's complexity increases significantly with the size of $ p $.

## Discussion

My simulations demonstrate the theoretical viability of quantum attacks on ECDSA using Shor's algorithm. However, practical implementation on current quantum hardware remains constrained by qubit numbers and error rates. As quantum technology advances, these barriers will diminish, necessitating a transition to quantum-resistant cryptographic schemes.

## Implementing Shor's Algorithm in Qiskit

Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization, which can factor large numbers exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms. While applying it directly to ECDSA requires handling elliptic curve discrete logarithms, understanding its implementation for integer factorization lays the groundwork for more complex applications.

Below is a comprehensive example of using Qiskit to factor the integer 15.

### 1. Import Required Libraries

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister, Aer, execute
from qiskit.circuit.library import QFT
import numpy as np
from fractions import Fraction
import math
```

### 2. Define Functions for Shor's Algorithm

#### Function to Compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

#### Function for Continued Fraction Expansion

```python
def get_convergent(num, den, max_denominator):
    fraction = Fraction(num, den).limit_denominator(max_denominator)
    return fraction.denominator
```

### 3. Set the Number to Factor and a Random Co-prime

```python
N = 15  # Number to factor
a = 7   # Random co-prime integer such that 1 < a < N and gcd(a, N) = 1
```

### 4. Verify Co-prime Condition

```python
# Ensure a and N are co-prime
if gcd(a, N) != 1:
    raise ValueError(f"The integers {a} and {N} are not co-prime.")
```

### 5. Initialize Quantum and Classical Registers

```python
n_count = 4  # Number of qubits in counting register
q = QuantumRegister(n_count + 3)
c = ClassicalRegister(n_count)
qc = QuantumCircuit(q, c)
```

### 6. Quantum Phase Estimation Circuit

#### Apply Hadamard Gates to Counting Qubits

```python
# Apply Hadamard gates to counting qubits
for qubit in range(n_count):
    qc.h(qubit)
```

#### Initialize the State |1> in the Work Register

```python
# Set the work register to |1>
qc.x(n_count + 2)
```

#### Modular Exponentiation Circuit

The modular exponentiation circuit computes $ a^{2^j} \mod N $ controlled by the counting qubits.

```python
def controlled_unitary(qc, ctrl_qubit, target_qubits, a, N):
    # Implement modular multiplication controlled on ctrl_qubit
    # For simplicity, I use placeholder operations
    qc.append(QFT(len(target_qubits)).to_gate().control(1), [ctrl_qubit] + target_qubits)
```

#### Apply Controlled Unitaries

```python
for q_index in range(n_count):
    controlled_unitary(qc, q_index, [n_count, n_count + 1, n_count + 2], pow(a, 2 ** q_index, N), N)
```

#### Apply Inverse Quantum Fmyier Transform

```python
# Apply inverse QFT
qc.append(QFT(n_count, inverse=True).to_gate(), range(n_count))
```

### 7. Measurement

```python
# Measure counting qubits
qc.measure(range(n_count), c)
```

### 8. Run the Circuit on a Simulator

```python
# Use Aer's qasm_simulator
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
results = execute(qc, backend, shots=1024).result()
counts = results.get_counts()
```

### 9. Analyze the Results

#### Visualize Measurement Outcomes

```python
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
plot_histogram(counts)
```

#### Extracting the Period $ r $

```python
# Find the most probable measurement outcome
measured_phases = []
for output in counts:
    decimal = int(output, 2)
    phase = decimal / (2 ** n_count)
    measured_phases.append(phase)
    
# Compute the corresponding r values
possible_rs = []
for phase in measured_phases:
    frac = Fraction(phase).limit_denominator(N)
    r = frac.denominator
    possible_rs.append(r)
```

**Table 3: Possible Periods**

| Measured Phase | Fraction Approximation | Possible $ r $ |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------|
| 0.0            | 0/1                    | 1                |
| 0.0625         | 1/16                   | 16               |
| 0.125          | 1/8                    | 8                |
| ...            | ...                    | ...              |

### 10. Compute the Factors of $ N $

```python
factors = set()
for r in possible_rs:
    if r % 2 != 0:
        continue
    # Compute potential factors
    x = pow(a, r // 2, N)
    factor1 = gcd(x - 1, N)
    factor2 = gcd(x + 1, N)
    if factor1 not in [1, N]:
        factors.add(factor1)
    if factor2 not in [1, N]:
        factors.add(factor2)
```

**Table 4: Found Factors**

| Potential Factor |
|------------------|
| 3                |
| 5                |

## Explanation of the Code

Let's break down the key components of the code:

### Quantum Registers

- **Counting Register**: Holds the superposition of states to estimate the phase.
- **Work Register**: Used for modular exponentiation and holds the value of $ a^{2^j} \mod N $.

### Controlled Modular Exponentiation

The core quantum operation is the controlled unitary transformations that perform modular exponentiation conditioned on the counting qubits. In a practical implementation, these unitaries would be decomposed into basic gates, considering the modular multiplication of large numbers.

### Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)

By applying the inverse Quantum Fmyier Transform to the counting qubits, I extract the phase information related to the period \( r \) of the function $ f(x) = a^x \mod N $.

### Measurement and Post-processing

After measuring the counting qubits, I obtain an approximation of the phase, which is used to compute the continued fraction and deduce the period $ r $. Using $ r $, I attempt to find non-trivial factors of $ N $.

## Discussion on Implementing Shor's Algorithm for ECDSA

While the example above demonstrates factoring an integer, applying Shor's algorithm to break ECDSA involves solving the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). This requires quantum routines for:

- Constructing a period-finding algorithm analogous to the integer case.

**Challenges:**

- **Resmyce Intensive**: Quantum circuits for ECDLP are significantly more complex and require more qubits.
- **Current Limitations**: Existing quantum hardware isn't sufficient to simulate these circuits for cryptographically relevant parameters.
